      <h2>CURRENT PROJECTS</h2>

      <h3>üïí Real Time Clock (RTC)</h3>
      <p>
        A realtime clock with togglable Seconds, and Ticks, new modes, and MORE!
      </p>
      <h4>Changelog</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>v1.0.0 - Official Release!</li>
          <li><span style="color:#ffff55">v1.1.0 - Fixed the jittering on the Rotating Time, properly flipped the Backwards time mode, the Minecraft clock is now properly synced with the time, and a few fixes have been made to Crazycolors, but you'll have to figure them out for yourself, heheheheh >:)</span><br><span style=color:"#555555">Psst, let me give you a hint! They have a 6 in them</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>‚è≤Ô∏è Countdown Timer</h3>
      <p>
        A super customizable timer with togglable Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Ticks! (Psst! Don't worry! I added those to the Stopwatch as well!)
      </p>
      <h4>Changelog</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>v1.0 - Original Release! Multiple styles and customization!</li>
          <ul>
              <li>v1.0.10 - Fixed the outline looking like gridlines and fixed a bug where the STANDARD timer disappears when attempting to be edited</li>
          </ul>
          <li>v1.1.0 - Made the dropdowns and checkboxes native</li>
          <li><span style="color:#ffff55">v1.2.0 - The Mario timers can now play music. To keep the timers more authentic, the HURRY UP will speed up the music in each style. The STANDARD timer now has the RTC's clock modes, along with a new AUTO checkbox which hides zeroed out places and the ability to play music with Hurry Up options! Plus once the timer falls below or is started under One Minute, the timer will now flash red in the <span style="color:#00ffff">Standard</span> clock mode<br>
                                * Bare in mind that the music does not yet work. I am working to fix that, but it may take some time </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h3>‚è±Ô∏è Stopwatch</h3>
      <p>
        A stopwatch timer that was inspired off of
        <a href="https://twitch.tv/jcog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jcog</a>'s timer, but with no craziness. I just wanted it to be custom :)
      </p>
      <h4>Changelog</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.0 - Original Release, Barebones, One font</li>
        <li><del>v1.1 - "Readability" font setting, Dropdown for ms customization</del> SCRAPPED</strong></li>
        <li>
          v1.2 - Slight revamp of the clock and code
          <ul>
            <li>‚ö™ White text on ‚¨õ black background (easier for colour change editing)</li>
            <li>
              New Settings menu with a font changer. The display has a "forced monospace" property which will eliminate the jitteriness of otherwise professional fonts, making them easier to read, and better on the eyes.
              <ul>
                <li>Default</strong> - Fancy Cat PX. A tabular font suitable for a clock!</li>
                <li>System</strong> - An OS-specific setting. iOS/Mac will use San Francisco, Android will use Roboto, and Windows will use Segoe UI</li>
                <li>Custom</strong> - Upload your own TTF, OTF, or WOFF. Note</strong>: You may need to refresh the page once you've uploaded a file!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The Stopwatch itself now uses the "wall-clock" method of keeping track of elapsed time, which is a fancy way of saying it no longer freezes when unfocusing or minimizing the tab or window altogether.
            </li>
</ul>
            <li>v1.2.10 - Added icons to the files and reworked the settings button / modal text</strong></li>
            <li>v1.2.11 - Fixed the CLOSE SETTINGS button. It now uses a hue shifted ‚ùé Cross Mark Button</strong></li>
            <li>v1.2.2 - New options to hide the options in the stopwatch (i.e. Hours, Mins, etc)</li>
            <li><span style="color:#ffff55">v1.3.0 - Made the dropdowns and checkboxes native</span></li>
          </ul>
