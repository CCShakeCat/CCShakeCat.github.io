      <h3>üïí Real Time Clock (RTC)</h3>
      <p>
        A realtime clock with togglable Seconds, and Ticks, new modes, and MORE!
      </p>
      <h4>Changelog</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>v1.0.0 - Official Release!</li>
          <li><span style="color:#ffff55">v1.1.0 - Fixed the jittering on the Rotating Time, properly flipped the Backwards time mode, the Minecraft clock is now properly synced with the time, and a few fixes have been made to Crazycolors, but you'll have to figure them out for yourself, heheheheh >:)</span><br><span style=color:"#555555">Psst, let me give you a hint! They have a 6 in them</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>‚è≤Ô∏è Countdown Timer</h3>
      <p>
        A super customizable timer with togglable Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Ticks! (Psst! Don't worry! I added those to the Stopwatch as well!)
      </p>
      <h4>Changelog</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>v1.0 - Original Release! Multiple styles and customization!</li>
          <ul>
              <li>v1.0.10 - Fixed the outline looking like gridlines and fixed a bug where the STANDARD timer disappears when attempting to be edited</li>
          </ul>
          <li>v1.1.0 - Made the dropdowns and checkboxes native</li>
          <li>v1.2.0 - The Mario timers can now play music. To keep the timers more authentic, the HURRY UP will speed up the music in each style. The STANDARD timer now has the RTC's clock modes, along with a new AUTO checkbox which hides zeroed out places and the ability to play music with Hurry Up options! Plus once the timer falls below or is started under One Minute, the timer will now flash red in the <span style="color:#00ffff">Standard</span> clock mode<br>
                                * Bare in mind that the music does not yet work on the STANDARD mode. I am working to fix that, but it may take some time </li>
                   <ul>
                       <li>v1.2.10 - Added a new style based on Sonic Lost World's HUD, following the same music system as the Mario timers. Also, removed the unintentionally accessible "Wii" subpage that takes you to the old NSMB timer.<br>
                                                        * Bare in mind that the layout is still bugged and the music does still not  work. I am working to fix that, but it may take some time</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="color:#ffff55">v1.3.0 - New styles in the Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros 3 modes. The rest will be updated at a later date. SMB1 and 3 are the most polished right now</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Super Mario Bros now has two new modes: Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels, and Super Mario All Stars (Yes, the SNES port's style has been added!). Note that the Genesis Hurry Up checkbox still exists, but it will be overridden by the Super Mario All-Stars style<br>
                        Please keep in mind that if any letter is only in the 1's or 10's place on SMB, the timer will not commence. You need to have a letter in the 100's place</li>
                        <li>Super Mario Bros 3 now has it's icon for the timer instead of that ugly TIME text. It also has recieved it's SNES couterpart's style, too!<br>
                        Letters will NOT work for now in the SMB3 style <br><br>
                            
                        Both of these bugs will be fixed at a later date. Sorry for the inconvenience</li>
              </ul>
          </li>

      <h3>‚è±Ô∏è Stopwatch</h3>
      <p>
        A stopwatch timer that was inspired off of
        <a href="https://twitch.tv/jcog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jcog</a>'s timer, but with no craziness. I just wanted it to be custom :)
      </p>
      <h4>Changelog</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.0 - Original Release, Barebones, One font</li>
        <li><del>v1.1 - "Readability" font setting, Dropdown for ms customization</del> SCRAPPED</strong></li>
        <li>
          v1.2 - Slight revamp of the clock and code
          <ul>
            <li>‚ö™ White text on ‚¨õ black background (easier for colour change editing)</li>
            <li>
              New Settings menu with a font changer. The display has a "forced monospace" property which will eliminate the jitteriness of otherwise professional fonts, making them easier to read, and better on the eyes.
              <ul>
                <li>Default</strong> - Fancy Cat PX. A tabular font suitable for a clock!</li>
                <li>System</strong> - An OS-specific setting. iOS/Mac will use San Francisco, Android will use Roboto, and Windows will use Segoe UI</li>
                <li>Custom</strong> - Upload your own TTF, OTF, or WOFF. Note</strong>: You may need to refresh the page once you've uploaded a file!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The Stopwatch itself now uses the "wall-clock" method of keeping track of elapsed time, which is a fancy way of saying it no longer freezes when unfocusing or minimizing the tab or window altogether.
            </li>
</ul>
            <li>v1.2.10 - Added icons to the files and reworked the settings button / modal text</strong></li>
            <li>v1.2.11 - Fixed the CLOSE SETTINGS button. It now uses a hue shifted ‚ùé Cross Mark Button</strong></li>
            <li>v1.2.2 - New options to hide the options in the stopwatch (i.e. Hours, Mins, etc)</li>
            <li>v1.3.0 - Made the dropdowns and checkboxes native</li>
            <li>v1.4.0 - New SPEEDRUNNER MODE (Similar to LiveSplit ) and a Tick Rate dropdown. LET THERE BE MORE TICKS PER SECOND!</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color:#ffff55">v1.4.10 - New KEYBINDS menu to set START/STOP and RESET functions<br>
                    Press your keybind within three seconds of pressing the button<br>
                    If you accidentally press RESET, you'd have to hold. I thought about that ;)</span></li>
